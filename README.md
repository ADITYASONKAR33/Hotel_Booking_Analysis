This Python project provides an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data. It leverages various data processing and visualization techniques to uncover insights related to booking trends, customer demographics, and seasonal patterns. The project includes:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to identify key patterns and trends.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance model performance and insight generation.
Predictive Modeling: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict booking trends and customer behavior.
Results and Visualization: Generating clear, actionable insights through charts and graphs.
This repository includes the code, datasets, and documentation needed to replicate the analysis or extend it for further research.
